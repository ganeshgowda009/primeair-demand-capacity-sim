# Demand Forecasting & Capacity Planning Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a lightweight demand planning workflow including:
- Rolling 3-month demand forecasting
- Inventory projection (Ending Inventory + MOS)
- Capacity utilization analysis
- Demand spike scenario simulation (+20%)

## Business Context
Last-mile delivery operations require accurate forecasting and capacity planning to maintain service-level targets while controlling cost. This project shows how demand variability impacts inventory risk and operational readiness.

## Key Features
- Forecast: Rolling 3-month average
- Inventory Projection: Ending Inventory simulation + Months of Supply (MOS)
- Capacity Planning: Utilization% baseline vs demand-spike scenario
- Outputs: PNG plots + CSV results
